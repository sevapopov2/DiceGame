This is a simple dice game that was written in Java for object oriented programming practice.
Plan.
There are 2 players in the game. For example: Andrey and Anna.
Each player can roll a dice.
And each player has itâ€™s own name and unique id.
Also the player is the loser by default, it may be changed in the future.
The dice has 6 ages, the random number from 1 to 6 is displayed when the dice is rolled.
There is a game method that will control the game process itself.
It can start a game and stop it.
When the game is started, 2 dices are rolled.
Each player rolls 1 dice.
There is the method that displays the winner.
There is also a player list.
I believe there is no sense in making dices list because there will be only 1 dice object.
The app is rewritten from zero due to the fact that the previous experience was a failure even if I could reproduce the part of the game.
